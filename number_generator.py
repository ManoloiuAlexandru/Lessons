'''The row defined by the following is considered
recurrence relation:
a) Write only the header of a subprogram sub, which receives through parameter n
a natural number of maximum 8 digits, and which returns the largest term of the string
above smaller or at most equal to n.
Example: if n = 83 then the subprogram will return the value 80. (4p.)
b) Write a program that reads from the keyboard a natural number s (sâ‰¤10000000)
and determines a number of distinct numbers whose sum is equal to s, using useful calls
of the subprogram below. The determined numbers will be written on
the first line separated by a space.
Example: if the value read from the keyboard is 63, then the following values, not necessarily in this order: 40 20 3.'''
