1. What is the complexity of bubble sort,explain why ?
    The complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n^2) in the average case and in the best case is O(n). This happens because 
you iterate through the array and check if the current element needs to be swapped. This algorithm is efficient on space because the only thing 
you add to the program is another variable. The best case happens when the array is sorted so the only thing you have to do is to iterate it.
