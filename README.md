# Lessons
Here you can find different problems and solutions. On different subjects that are teached in high school and university.


These lessons are for anyone who wants to start to learn programming. The problems are so that you can understand the basics of the language. The language that the problems are solved is C++,Java and Python . In order to run the solutions for C++ you need to have visual studio code installed or any program that can run C++,Java,Go or Python code. For these people that are wondering why you study C++ it is because it is a very low language and if you know it you can write cod that works directly on the computer processor making the program run faster. 
Also in here you can see the difference between C++,Java and Python.

***NOTE: The problems that you will find in university are made in Python. The problems for high school are made in C++.***
