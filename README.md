# Lessons
Here you can find different problems and solutions. On different subjects that are teached in school.


These lessons are for anyone who wants to start to learn programming. The problems in the basics are so that you can understand the basics of the language. The language that the problems are solved is C++. In order to run the solutions you need to have codebloks installed or any program that can run C++ code. For these people that are wondering why you study C++ it is because it is a very low language and if you know it you can write cod that works directly on the computer processor making the program run faster.
