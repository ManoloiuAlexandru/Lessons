Lessons
Welcome!
Here you’ll find a collection of problems and solutions covering a range of topics taught in both high school and university programming courses.

These lessons are perfect for anyone starting to learn programming. Each problem is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. By comparing the same problems across multiple languages, you’ll also gain insight into their differences.

To run the code, you can use Visual Studio Code or any environment that supports C++, Java, Go, or Python.

Why C++?
C++ is considered a lower-level language that offers closer interaction with the computer’s processor. Learning it helps you understand how programs work under the hood and can lead to more efficient code.

✅ High school-level problems are primarily solved in C++.
✅ University-level problems are written in Python.
