1. What is the complexity of bubble sort,explain why ?
    The complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n^2) in the average case and in the best case is O(n). This happens because 
you iterate through the array and check if the current element needs to be swapped. This algorithm is efficient on space because the only thing 
you add to the program is another variable. The best case happens when the array is sorted so the only thing you have to do is to iterate it.

2. What are the difference between list and array ?
    An array is smaller than the list because a list is made up of nodes and these nodes contain: the value of the node and the pointer to the 
next node. The list will grow as more ellements are added to it while for the array it's starts with a fixed length. You can get the elements from
an array by using index while to get the elements from a list you need to iterate the list so you can find the element you are looking for.
Inserting and deleting an element in a list has O(1) time while in an array is more complex if you have to insert or delete an element from the array.
